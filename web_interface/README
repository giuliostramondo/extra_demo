* Installation
The supported version of python is python2.7. Installing this version of python in centos 6.5 is possible using scl:
https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/2.1/cassandra/install/installPython27RHEL.html

Ensure to enable the python27.

The file requirements.txt should list all the python packages required by the webserver. 
Install these packages using pip:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

The installation of numpy inside the virtual enviroment required packages external to python : Blas, Atlas, Lapack.
First check if these libraries are installed in the system using:
    ldconfig -p | grep blas 
    ldconfig -p | grep atlas 
    ldconfig -p | grep lapack 
These command will tell the location in which the libraries are installed - if the are installed. 
Once the libraries have been located the solution I found to install numpy in venv was to check the libraries
that pip was missing during the numpy installation and manually copy them inside venv/lib/ 

The installation of matplotlib in the virtual environment required libpng-devel
    sudo yum install libpng-devel

The solver functions inside prf_utils.py rely on the python package enum34
    pip install enum34 ( in the virtual environment )

* To start the server

Enable python 2.7
    scl enable python27 bash

Activate the virtual environment
    source venv/bin/activate 

Create a tunnel between the machine using the backend and the backend
    ssh -D 8080 giuliostramondo@fpga_uva (from the mac)

Configure the proxy on the mac to use the socket proxy at localhost 8080
